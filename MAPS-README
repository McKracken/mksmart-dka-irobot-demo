HOW TO SET UP THE MAP PARAMETERS FOR THE DEMO

PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTION: here we assume that a simulated or real robot is working, and everything is correctly aligned (e.g. the robot is correctly localised, ...), and move_base is correctly running with a map, which we'll call "the original map" from now on.

First of all, you need to understand if the map used in the application has been cropped and/or resized with respect ot the original map. You will need to have access to both the image file of the original map and the related .yaml file loaded by move_base to get some crucial infos.

Example of map parameters in the JSON configuration file loaded at the start of the demo web application

"map":{
	"img":"./docs/north-south-wings+podium_merge_cut_resized.png",
	"xoffset":548,
	"yoffset":271,
	"scale":0.167,
	"invertaxes":false,
	"xmultiplier":1,
	"ymultiplier":-1
}

- img: the path specifing where the map used in the web application is located
- xoffset and yoffset: these are the coordinates in pixel of the origin the image specified in the "img" parameter. This is needed in case of resizing/cropping of the original map. If the original map has been resized, the origin has to be approximated.
- scale: this is a tricky parameter. It must be evaluated this way: take the value of the resolution parameter .yaml file used by move_base and divide it by the percentage (as decimal) of reduction to which the original image has been resize. For example, if the original map has a resolution of 0.05 (in the .yaml file) and the image used in the web app (under the "img" parameter) is the result of reducing the original map to the 30% of its size (notice: 30% of it size, no 30% less then its size), the this value would be 0.05/0.3 = 0.167 (rounded).
- invertaxes: this is a boolean flag that is used in the case in which the axes X and Y are inverted. You can check it opening rviz.
- xmultiplier and ymultiplier: again on the invertion of the axes.
